Summary of the Case
Mr. Cameron and Mr. Speakman formed a partnership to acquire Westerly Winery.  In summary, Mr. Speakman was to provide the financing and Mr. Cameron was to provide expertise in the wine industry.  Eventually there was a dispute between Cameron and Speakman with Cameron claiming amounts contributed by Speakman were in exchange for equity and Speakman claiming it was a loan.  Cameron as the plaintiff (called a claimant in arbitration) then sued Speakman for breach of their partnership agreement.  The deposition transcript in question is the deposition of Mr. Cameron making his claims that Mr. Speakman breached their partnership agreement.  There is one difference here relative to our previous explanation: in arbitration, the complaint is called Demand for Arbitration, the plaintiff is called the Claimant and the defendant is called the respondent.
