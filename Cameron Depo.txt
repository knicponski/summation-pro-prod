              5                          BRIAN CAMERON,

              6            CALLED AS A WITNESS BY AND ON BEHALF OF

              7            THE DEFENDANTS, BEING FIRST DULY SWORN,

              8            WAS EXAMINED AND TESTIFIED AS FOLLOWS:

              9

             10                        DIRECT EXAMINATION

             11

             12    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             13          Q.      WOULD PLEASE STATE AND SPELL YOUR NAME FOR

             14    THE RECORD.

             15          A.      BRIAN CAMERON, B-R-I-A-N.  CAMERON,

             16    C-A-M-E-R-O-N.

             17          Q.      HAVE YOU EVER HAD YOUR DEPOSITION TAKEN

             18    BEFORE?

             19          A.      NO.

             20          Q.      OKAY.  HOPEFULLY, YOUR LAWYER, WHO IS

             21    PRESENT HERE, HAS GIVEN YOU A LITTLE BIT OF ADVICE ON THE

             22    PROCESS.  BUT SINCE YOU'RE NEW, I'LL KIND OF GO OVER IT

             23    AGAIN.  I THINK THE ROMANS SAID REPETITION IS THE MOTHER

             24    OF MEMORY.

             25          SO WHAT'S A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE ABOUT A DEPOSITION IS

             26    WE HAVE A COURT REPORTER WHO'S TAKING EVERYTHING DOWN.

             27    IN NORMAL CONVERSATION, PEOPLE HAVE A TENDENCY TO TALK

             28    OVER ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE SOMETIMES BEFORE SOMEONE FINISHES






                                                                            5







              1    A SENTENCE, YOU HAVE IN YOUR MIND WHAT THE ANSWER IS, SO

              2    YOU KIND OF BLURT OUT THE ANSWER BEFORE THEY FINISH THE

              3    SENTENCE.  IN NORMAL CONVERSATION, NO PROBLEM.

              4          HOWEVER, TODAY, ITS PURPOSE IS -- IT MAKES IT VERY

              5    DIFFICULT FOR THE COURT REPORTER TO TAKE EVERYTHING DOWN.

              6    SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK LIKE ONE PERSON AT A

              7    TIME AND TO WAIT UNTIL I FINISH MY QUESTION.  THE OTHER

              8    ADVANTAGE IS IF I FINISH MY QUESTION, IF YOUR LAWYER HAS

              9    AN OBJECTION OR WANTS TO INSTRUCT YOU NOT TO ANSWER, HE'LL

             10    HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT.

             11          AND IF YOU JUST BLURT OUT THE ANSWER, THEN YOU'RE

             12    DEPRIVING YOURSELF OF THE VALUE OF HAVING YOUR LAWYER

             13    HERE.  SO THAT'S ONE OF THE SEVERAL REASONS WHY WE DON'T

             14    WANT TO DO IT.  PLUS, THE COURT REPORTER, AS I SAID, CAN

             15    ONLY TAKE DOWN ONE OF US AT A TIME.  SO GO AHEAD AND THINK

             16    ABOUT MY QUESTION.

             17          IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION AND YOU'RE NOT SURE OR

             18    YOU'RE NOT CLEAR ON WHAT THE QUESTION IS, PLEASE LET ME

             19    KNOW.  AND I'LL TRY TO ASK A BETTER QUESTION.  THIS IS A

             20    DEPOSITION.  IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE A PUNISHMENT EVEN

             21    THOUGH NO ONE LIKES GOING ON THE SPOT.

             22          AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IF YOU NEED SOME WATER OR

             23    IF YOU NEED TO USE THE RESTROOM, JUST LET ME KNOW AND

             24    WE'LL TAKE A BREAK.  HOWEVER, IF I HAVE A QUESTION PENDING

             25    AND YOU WANT TO TAKE A BREAK, I CAN COMMENT THAT YOU TOOK

             26    A BREAK AND YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO COUNSEL WITH YOUR

             27    LAWYER, COUNSEL ABOUT THE QUESTION.

             28          IF YOU NEED TO TALK TO YOUR LAWYER TO ANSWER A






                                                                            6







              1    QUESTION, THAT'S OKAY.  YOU CAN ASK TO DO THAT, BUT I CAN

              2    COMMENT ABOUT THAT AT THE TIME OF THE HEARING IN THE

              3    MATTER; BUT YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT.

              4          ALSO, A LOT OF THE TIMES YOUR LAWYER -- IT WILL

              5    SOUND LIKE AN INTERRUPTION -- WILL MAKE AN OBJECTION.

              6    THAT'S FOR THE RECORD AND FOR THE ARBITRATOR WHO'S GOING

              7    TO BASICALLY ACT AS THE JUDGE, IN THIS CASE, TO DECIDE TO

              8    RULE ON THE OBJECTION.

              9          SO IF YOU JUST HEAR AN OBJECTION, YOU'RE STILL

             10    OBLIGATED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION.  AND THEN THE RULING ON

             11    THAT OBJECTION WILL HAPPEN LATER.

             12          THE DIFFERENCE IS IF YOUR LAWYER OBJECTS AND

             13    INSTRUCTS YOU NOT TO ANSWER, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO EITHER

             14    FOLLOW THE ADVICE OR NOT.  BUT THERE MAY BE A MOTION TO

             15    COMPEL WHERE YOU MAY BE ORDERED LATER ON TO ANSWER THE

             16    QUESTION OR NOT.

             17          BUT UNLESS YOUR LAWYER INSTRUCTS YOU NOT TO ANSWER

             18    THE QUESTION, YOU NEED TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASK.

             19    THERE MAY BE TIMES WHERE I ASK YOU A QUESTION IN THE

             20    MORNING AND YOU CAN'T REMEMBER AND YOU MAY HAVE A MEMORY

             21    LATER ON TODAY, SOMETHING TRIGGERED YOUR MEMORY OR

             22    WHATEVER ELSE.

             23          I'LL JUST TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE, THAT IT LOOKS A

             24    LOT BETTER IF YOU SUDDENLY HAVE THE EPIPHANY TO ANSWER THE

             25    QUESTION TODAY THAN IT DOES 30 DAYS LATER AFTER YOU GET

             26    THE BOOKLET.  LIKE, OH, I REMEMBER THE ANSWER.  SO I CAN

             27    COMMENT THAT YOU COULDN'T THINK OF IT, BUT AFTER HAVING

             28    OTHER TIMES TO LOOK AT THINGS, YOU SUDDENLY HAVE MEMORY.






                                                                            7







              1          ALL RIGHT.  DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

              2    PROCESS?

              3          A.      NO, THANK YOU.

              4          Q.      OKAY.  ALL RIGHT.  ALL RIGHT.  SO LET'S KIND

              5    OF BEGIN.  WE WERE HERE ABOUT THE WESTERLY WINE BUSINESS.

              6    SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME HOW YOU GOT INVOLVED IN THE

              7    BUSINESS.

              8          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECT TO THE FORM OF THE QUESTION.

              9          MR. ARMSTRONG:  YOU CAN ANSWER.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE.

             10    I ASK YOU A QUESTION.  YOUR LAWYER MAKES AN OBJECTION ON

             11    THE RECORD, AND YOU CAN ANSWER.

             10    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             11          Q.      OKAY.  AND AS FAR AS THE DATES AND TIMES GO,

             12    IT WAS, LIKE --

              5          A.      TO FIND SOME BUSINESS PARTNERS OR BASICALLY

              7          Q.      OKAY.  AND WHEN YOU STARTED HAVING THESE

              8    CONVERSATIONS WITH MICHAEL SPEAKMAN, WAS THIS IN -- WHAT

             10          A.      YES.

             11          Q.      IF YOU KNOW, DO YOU RECALL ABOUT WHEN IT WAS

             12    THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS OF MICHAEL SPEAKMAN BEGINNING --

             13    BECOMING MORE INVOLVED WITH WESTERLY WINE AS AN OWNER?

             14          A.      THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AFTER WE STARTED IN THE

             15    INITIAL CONVERSATION, WE WERE ENGAGING MORE.

             16          Q.      WERE THERE ANY DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO

             17    OF YOU DURING THAT PERIOD OF THREE TO FOUR MONTHS PERIOD

             18    AS TO WHAT MICHAEL SPEAKMAN'S ROLE WOULD BE IN THE

             19    COMPANY?

             20          A.      FINANCIALLY HELP OUT WITH THE FINANCES.

             21          Q.      AND YOUR ROLE WOULD STAY THE SAME AS IT WAS

             22    PREVIOUSLY WITH FIRST STEP BEVERAGE?

             24          Q.      THAT'S A "YES"?

             25          A.      YES.

              1    A LOT OF IT IS NON-VERBAL.  SO A LOT OF TIMES WE SHAKE OUR

              2    HEADS OR PEOPLE SAY "UH-HUH" OR "HUH-UH."  THE PROBLEM IS

              3    IT'S HARD TO TRANSCRIBE -- TRANSCRIPT SOUNDS.

              4          YOU KNOW, IF IT'S A HEAD SHAKE, IT'S NOT CLEAR.  IF

              5    IT'S UP AND DOWN HEAD SHAKE, LIKE A NODDING LIKE A "YES"

              6    OR SIDE-BY-SIDE HEAD SHAKE MEANING "NO."  SO IT'S

              7    IMPORTANT TO VERBALIZE AND TO USE THE TERMS "YES" OR "NO"

              8    FOR YES OR NO.

              9          FAIR ENOUGH?

             10          A.      YES.

             11          Q.      OKAY.  LIKE I SAID, IT'S KIND OF A STRANGE

             12    COMMUNICATION -- COMMUNICATION EVENT, THESE THINGS, BUT

             13    HERE THEY ARE.

             14          OKAY.  AND AT SOME POINT, THERE WAS DISCUSSIONS OF

             15    ROGER BOWER LEAVING WESTERLY WINE.  WERE YOU INVOLVED IN

             16    ANY OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS?

             17          A.      ROGER WANTED TO SELL THE BRAND.

             18          Q.      WHEN YOU SAY HE WANTED TO SELL THE BRAND,

             19    LIKE, HE WANTED TO HAVE SOMEBODY BUY HIM OUT?

             20          A.      YES.

             21          Q.      OKAY.  AND ABOUT WHEN DID ROGER BOWER

             22    COMMUNICATE THAT TO YOU, THE BEST YOU CAN RECALL?

             23          A.      THAT WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.  TWO YEARS

             24    AGO.

             25          Q.      SO SOMETIME IN 2017?

             26          A.      UH-HUH.

             27          Q.      IS THAT --

             28          A.      YES, YES.






                                                                           13







              1          Q.      AND THAT WAS ABOUT THE SAME TIME YOU STARTED

              2    HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH MICHAEL SPEAKMAN AT THE GYM?

              6    EVER OFFER YOU EQUITY OR ANY TYPES OF CONTRACTS OR

              7    AGREEMENTS TO BUY INTO WESTERLY WINE?

              8          A.      WE HAD GREAT CONVERSATIONS.  THERE WAS NO

              9    EQUITY OFFERED AT THAT TIME.  IT WAS MORE ABOUT FINDING AN

             10    OWNER OR SELLER OR BUYER I SHOULD SAY.

             11          Q.      DID ROGER EXPRESS TO YOU WHY HE WANTED OUT?

             12          A.      YES.  HE WANTED TO FOCUS ON HIS PREMIUM

             13    BRAND, CROWN POINT.

             14          Q.      IS THAT ANOTHER WINE?

             15          A.      IT IS.  IT'S THE -- THE WINERY ACTUALLY

             16    WHERE WESTERLY IS BOTTLED.

             17          Q.      IS THAT STILL BOTTLED THERE TODAY?

             18          A.      FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, YES.

             19          Q.      DO WESTERLY WINE AND CROWN POINT USE THE

             20    SAME FARMS FOR THEIR GRAPES?

             21          A.      YES.  FOR SOME, FOR THE STATE FRUIT AND THEN

             18    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             19          Q.      SO I KNOW AT SOME POINT IN 2017, THERE WERE

             20    MORE SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MICHAEL SPEAKMAN COMING

             21    INTO -- TO BUY OUT WESTERLY WINE FROM ROGER BOWER.

             26    INVESTMENT IN, AND YOU'RE LIKE, HEY, I'VE GOT THE BUSINESS

             27    KNOW-HOW AND SO THAT WOULD BE A 50/50 SPLIT?

             26    I DID NOT UNDERSTAND -- IT'S MY FIRST OPERATING AGREEMENT

             28    TO ME.






                                                                           32

             26          Q.      AND ALSO, IT LOOKS LIKE UNDER THE -- ONE,

             27    TWO THREE -- FOURTH PARAGRAPH, THERE'S LIKE A HANDWRITTEN

             28    NOTATION.






                                                                           33

              2          A.      MYSELF.

              3          Q.      IS THERE AN INITIAL THERE, OR IS THERE WORD

              4    WRITTEN IN?

              5          A.      IT'S AN INITIAL AND A PRINTING.

              9    OUT WHERE IT SAYS, "ALL MEMBERS"?

             10          A.      AGAIN, THIS WAS --

             11          Q.      DID YOU -- DID YOU DRAW THE LINE THROUGH THE

             12    WORDS "ALL MEMBERS"?

             13          A.      BRIAN OR MIKE IS ALL I READ.

             14          Q.      OKAY.  I'M JUST REFERRING TO THE LINE

             15    THROUGH --

             20          A.      I DON'T RECALL.

             22    LINE THROUGH THE TERMS ALL MEMBERS ON THIS DOCUMENT?

             23          A.      IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ME.

             24          Q.      OKAY.  AND ARE THESE INITIALS OR ARE THESE

             25    WORDS?

             26          A.      THAT'S MY INITIAL AND/OR MIKE.

             27          Q.      OKAY.  SO -- SO CAN YOU READ ME WHAT THE --

             28    WHAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTENT OF THE CHANGE WAS






                                                                           34

              3          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECT TO THE FORM OF THE LEADING

              4    QUESTION.  READ TO ME THE UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR INTENT.

              5    YOU WANT HIM TO READ TO HIM OR YOU WANT HIM TO EXPLAIN THE

              6    INTENT?

              8    WANT TO HIM READ TO ME HOW HE MEANT THE SENTENCE TO

              9    READ --

             10          MR. KATZMAN:  ALL RIGHT.

             11          MR. ARMSTRONG:  -- BASED ON THIS HANDWRITTEN

             12    NOTATION.

             13          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECTION.  ASKED AND ANSWERED.  I

             14    THOUGHT HE TOLD YOU ABOUT IT, BUT OKAY.

             15          MR. ARMSTRONG:  I DON'T -- WELL, I JUST WANT TO HEAR

             16    THE WHOLE SENTENCE BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

             17          THE WITNESS:  I DON'T EITHER.

             18    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             19          Q.      OKAY.  WELL, TRY -- CAN YOU JUST DO ME A

             20    FAVOR AND TRY TO READ.  BECAUSE I DIDN'T MAKE THESE MARKS.

             21    SO HAVE I NO CLUE, RIGHT.  I HAVE NO IDEA.

             22          SO WHAT WAS -- HOW WAS THE SENTENCE SUPPOSED TO

             23    READ?

             24          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECT TO THE FORM.

             25          MR. ARMSTRONG:  BASED ON THOSE NOTATIONS.

             26          THE WITNESS:  I DON'T KNOW.

             27    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             28          Q.      OKAY.  SO YOU INITIALED THESE NOTATIONS AND






                                                                           35







              1    YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN?

              2          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECT TO THE QUESTION OR FORM OF THE

              3    QUESTION.  HE TOLD YOU WHAT THEY SAY.

              4          MR. ARMSTRONG:  WHAT I GOT WAS HIS INITIALS AND THE

              5    WORD "A MIKE".

              6          MR. KATZMAN:  NO, HE SAID "OR MIKE."

              7          MR. ARMSTRONG:  OKAY.  O-R MIKE.

              8          MR. KATZMAN:  HE SAID THAT THREE TIMES.

              9    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             10          Q.      ALL RIGHT.  SO IT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING THE

             11    SENTENCE SHOULD READ THEN, "NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED

             12    THAT PURSUANT TO AND SUBJECT TO THE OA" -- WHICH IS THE

             13    OPERATING AGREEMENT -- "THE COMPANY SHALL MAKE A CAPITAL

             14    CALL TO BRIAN OR MIKE IN THE AMOUNT OF $425,000"; IS THAT

             15    CORRECT?

             16          A.      THAT IS CORRECT.

             17          Q.      ALL RIGHT.  AND SO THE FIRST HEADING REFERS

             18    TO A MEMBER CAPITAL CALL.

             19          DO YOU RECALL HAVING ANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A CAPITAL

             20    CALL WITH MICHAEL SPEAKMAN?

             21          A.      THE OA -- A LOAN, NOT A CAPITAL CALL

             22    THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION.  IT WAS A LOAN.  NEVER

             23    A CAPITAL CALL, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS THE CAPITAL CALL.

             24          Q.      YOU THOUGHT THE LOAN AND THE CAPITAL CALL

             25    WERE THE SAME THING?

             26          A.      YES.

             27          Q.      OKAY.  AND WHY DID YOU THINK THAT?

             28          A.      BECAUSE ORIGINALLY, THAT'S WHAT -- HE SENT






                                                                           36

              4    MICHAEL SPEAKMAN LOANED THE COMPANY MONEY?

              5          A.      YES.

              6          Q.      ALL RIGHT.  AND SO WHERE IN THESE

              7    DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU HAD WITH MICHAEL SPEAKMAN BEFORE

              8    SIGNING THIS DOCUMENT, DID YOU HAVE ANY WRITTEN DISCUSSION

              9    WITH HIM ABOUT THE CAPITAL CALL, AS BEST YOU CAN RECALL?

             10          A.      THE ORIGINAL ONE WAS COMING BACK TO ME WAS

             11    HIS WIFE AND HIM AGREED TO PUT UP ADDITIONAL MONEY IN THE

             12    FORM OF A LOAN SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID TO START THE

             13    COMPANY.

             14          Q.      WERE THERE ANY E-MAILS OR ANYTHING

             15    REFLECTING THIS?

             16          A.      YES.

             17          Q.      AND IT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING THOSE E-MAILS

             18    HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN THIS CASE?

             19          A.      YES.

             20          Q.      AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE $425,000 WAS

             21    GOING TO BE A LOAN?

             22          A.      YES.

             23          MR. KATZMAN:  I'M SORRY.  OBJECTION.  THE $425,000

             24    REFLECTED IN THIS DOCUMENT?

             25          MR. ARMSTRONG:  YES.

             26          MR. KATZMAN:  OKAY.

             27    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             28          Q.      AND THAT WAS BASED ON VERBAL CONVERSATIONS

              4          Q.      YOU HAD WITH MICHAEL SPEAKMAN?

              5          A.      ONE MORE TIME, PLEASE.

              6          Q.      IN YOUR UNDERSTANDING, YOU CLAIMED THAT YOU

              7    UNDERSTOOD THAT THE $425,000 REFLECTED IN THIS CAPITAL

              8    CALL WAS GOING TO BE A LOAN BASED ON VERBAL CONVERSATIONS

              9    YOU HAD WITH MICHAEL SPEAKMAN AND E-MAILS EXCHANGED

              9    RECAP OF YEAR-TO-DATE DATE SALES BY SALESPERSON, DIRECT

             10    CONSUMER SALES WHICH NOW -- WAS PRESENTED AT THE MEETING.

             11          Q.      SO WOULD YOU SAY THAT -- WOULD IT BE FAIR TO

             12    CHARACTERIZE THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DATA ABOUT THE

             13    BUSINESS?

             14          A.      MORE ABOUT THE BUSINESS -- MORE ABOUT THE

             15    BUSINESS GOING FORWARD, AND WHAT WAS NEEDED, AND HOW IT

             16    WAS NEEDED, AND THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ANY ADDITIONAL

             17    PURCHASE OF WINE.

             18          Q.      DID YOU RECALL WHAT THOSE RISK FACTORS WERE?

             19          A.      I HAVE A -- I HAVE A LETTER DATED TO MIKE

             20    PRIOR TO THE MEETING ON THE 29TH OF MAY, THAT CLEARLY

             21    OUTLINES EIGHT DIFFERENT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS

             22    ASSOCIATED WITH THE BRAND THAT WAS CRITICAL TO MOVE THE

             23    BUSINESS FORWARD IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION.

             24          Q.      AND WHAT ITEMS IN YOUR VIEW WERE CRITICAL?

             25          A.      STARTING WITH THE YEAR-TO-DATE SALES AND THE

             26    PROFITABILITY, THE BUSINESS BY EACH -- IN OUR BUSINESS, WE

             27    REVIEW EACH WINE -- WINE ENTITY AS A BRAND ITSELF, THE

                                                                           46







              1    REMAINDER YEAR IN TWO YEARS.

              2          OUTLINED THREE SPECIFIC ITEMS THAT WERE A HIGH RISK

              3    TO PURCHASE INVENTORY, THE TUNE OF $187,000 OF INVENTORY

              4    WE DID NOT NEED.

              5          Q.      ABOUT HOW MUCH?

              6          A.      187,000 ESTIMATED.

              7          Q.      OKAY.

              8          A.      WE WERE CARRYING OVER A HUNDRED.  ACTUALLY,

              9    A YEAR'S WORTH OF INVENTORY CURRENTLY.  THE BUSINESS MODEL

             10    WAS GEARED TOWARDS CABERNET AND RED BLEND.  HE WAS

             11    ACQUIRING FIVE DIFFERENT SKUS THAT WE DID NOT NEED,

             12    ESPECIALLY FOR A NEW COMPANY TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL

             13    FINANCIAL RISK.

             14          Q.      AND WHAT WERE THE LINES OF THOSE SKUS?

             15          A.      IT WAS THE COTE BLONDE, SAUVIGNON BLANC,

             16    ROS.  THE -- THOSE ARE THE THREE OUT OF THE FIVE -- I'M

             17    SORRY.  THOSE THREE WERE CRITICAL IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS

             18    BEING PURCHASED AND WHAT WAS NEEDED.

             19          Q.      WAS PINOT NOIR ONE OF THEM?

             20          A.      PINOT NOIR WAS AN ASSET.  THAT WAS A

             21    GREAT -- THAT WAS A GREAT WINE.  I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN

             22    EASY SELL.

             23          Q.      OKAY.  WAS THAT ONE OF THE EXTRA SKUS OR WAS

             24    THAT --

             25          A.      NO.  THAT WAS JUST -- AGAIN, I MISSPOKE --

             26    THREE -- THREE ITEMS THAT I LISTED THAT WERE POTENTIALLY

             27    AT RISK.  I WANTED TO REVIEW ALL THE NUMBERS WITH HIM

             28    BEFORE WE MADE ANY DECISIONS ON ANY ADDITIONAL SPEND ON






                                                                           47







              1    THE COMPANY.

              2          Q.      SO YOU FELT THE COMPANY WAS SUCCESSFUL WITH

              3    THE CAB, AND THE RED BLEND, AND THE PINOT NOIR; AND SO THE

              4    CONCERN WAS ON BUYING THE COAT BLANC, THE SAUVIGNON BLANC,

              5    AND ROS?

              6          A.      IT WASN'T THE DIRECTION OF THE COMPANY.  WE

              7    WERE FOCUSING ON THE REDS, THE RED BLENDS, AND THE PINOT

              8    NOIR.

              9          Q.      WHICH IS RED?

             10          A.      RED BLEND.

             11          Q.      RED?

             12          A.      RIGHT.

             13          Q.      WAS THERE A CAB FRANC OR MERLOT, OR NO?

             14          A.      THERE WAS NO -- CABERNET FRANC AND MERLOT

             15    WERE NOT PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE WINERY.

             16          Q.      SOME OF THE OTHER BRANDS, LIKE THE SAUVIGNON

             17    BLANC AND ROS, WERE THEY TOO MANY SKUS?

             18          A.      YOU PUT RISK WHEN YOU BUY WHITE WINE.  YOU

             19    HAVE AN 18-MONTH WINDOW TO SELL WINE BECAUSE FINANCIAL

             20    RISK AND INVENTORY RISK -- UNLESS YOU HAVE A HOME FOR IT,

             21    RED WINE WILL DO FINE IN 24 OR 36 MONTHS OF SELLING.  YOU

             22    HAVE A MUCH LONGER GRACE PERIOD TO SELL RED WINE THAN YOU

             23    DO WHITE WINE.

             24          Q.      YEAH.

             25          A.      AND WESTERLY HAS ALREADY BEEN KNOWN FOR ITS

             26    REDS NOT ITS WHITES.

             27          Q.      SO YOUR CONCERN WAS THERE WAS TOO MUCH

             28    INVENTORY BEING PURCHASED IN THE WHITE WINE?






                                                                           48







              1          A.      NO.  ON THE EXISTING INVENTORY ON COTE

              2    BLONDE, WE HAD OVER TWO YEARS OF INVENTORY.  IT WAS A

              3    DIFFICULT, DIFFICULT SALE.  THE BRAND IS BEAUTIFUL BUT

              4    VERY TOUGH TO SELL.  ACQUIRE ANOTHER 80,000 WORTH OF

              5    INVENTORY WHEN WE HAD TWO YEARS OF INVENTORY WAS -- WAS A

              6    RISK.  I POINTED THAT OUT.

              7          Q.      LOOKING AT EXHIBIT 4, THE ITEM 1 SAYS,

              8    "MR. SPEAKMAN PROVIDED EACH MANAGING MEMBER WITH A

              9    PROPOSED PROMISSORY NOTE" --

             10          (REPORTER CLARIFICATION.)

             11          MR. ARMSTRONG:  OH, I'M SORRY.

             12    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             13          Q.      ITEM 1 SAYS, "MR. SPEAKMAN PROVIDED EACH

             14    MANAGING MEMBER WITH A PROPOSED PROMISSORY NOTE DATED

             15    OCTOBER 19TH, 2017, IN THE AMOUNT OF $652,593.

             16    MR. SPEAKMAN EXPLAINED THAT THE NOTE WAS PREPARED FOR

             17    SIGNATURE BY THE MANAGING MEMBERS TO DOCUMENT THE EXISTING

             18    LOAN TO WESTERLY WINE IN THE AMOUNT OF $652,593 IN THE

             19    TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT."

             20          DID THAT HAPPEN?

             21          A.      IT DID WITH A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND A LOT OF

             22    CIRCLING ON THE ACTUAL PROMISSORY NOTE.  I DID NOT HAVE

             23    THE TIME TO REVIEW IT AS MUCH AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED.  I

             24    FELT THE MEETING WAS GOING A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD.

             25          AND IN GOOD FAITH, I BASICALLY AGREED TO SIGN THE

             26    PROMISSORY NOTE, BUT I DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT

             27    AT LENGTH -- WHICH I SHOULD HAVE, BUT I DID NOT.

             28          Q.      THE NEXT PARAGRAPH STATES, "THERE FOLLOWED






                                                                           49







              1    CONSIDERABLE DISUNION OF THE VARIOUS TERMS OF THE NOTE,

              2    I.E., DATE, AMOUNT, INTEREST, PRINCIPLE REDUCTION, DEFAULT

              3    TERMS, LIABILITY UNDER FAULT BY THE LLC."

              4          DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT?

              5          A.      I AGREE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS

              6    THAT I HAD THAT I COULDN'T GET ANSWERED, AND I WAS VERY

              7    FRUSTRATED AT THE TIME.

              8          Q.      "AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE DISCUSSION, THE

              9    MANAGING MEMBERS, BRIAN CAMERON AND MICHAEL SPEAKMAN,

             10    VERBALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF THE

             11    NOTE AND SIGNED THE NOTE AS MANAGING MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF

             12    WESTERLY WINE."

             13          DID THAT HAPPEN?

             14          A.      THAT DID HAPPEN, YES.

             15          Q.      OKAY.  THEN, ITEM NO. 2 SAYS, "MR. SPEAKMAN

             16    REVIEWED THE CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION OF WESTERLY WINE

             17    AND THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FUND THE 2018

             18    PRODUCTION OF SALES.  THERE FOLLOWED THE DISCUSSION OF THE

             19    PROPOSED CAPITAL CALL IN THE AMOUNT OF $425,000.  THOUGH

             20    THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OF THE AMOUNT NEEDED, THERE WAS

             21    CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION ON THE ISSUE OF PERSONAL LIABILITY

             22    FOR THE DEBTS OF THE LLC."

             23          DID THAT HAPPEN?

             24          A.      NO.  I DON'T -- -- THAT, RIGHT THERE, DOES

             25    NOT -- I -- CONVERSATIONS WERE MADE THAT THERE WAS GOING

             26    TO BE ANOTHER LOAN AGAIN IN THE FORM OF $425,000.  THERE

             27    WAS NO FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE WESTERLY WINE.  I

             28    OUTLINED THE CONDITION OF THE COMPANY, PRIOR TO, THAT WE






                                                                           50







              1    DID NOT GO THROUGH.  THERE WAS AN ASSUMPTION ON

              2    MR. SPEAKMAN -- THE COMPANY WAS AT RISK.

              3          WE DID NOT GO THROUGH THE LINE-BY-LINE ITEM, WHICH

              4    WOULD HAVE SHOWED WHAT WAS NEEDED AND WHAT WAS NOT NEEDED.

              5    SO TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, I WOULD SAY, NO, I DID NOT --

              6    EVERYTHING THERE IS A LOT OF FALSITY TO THOSE PARTICULAR

              7    QUESTIONS IN THE STATEMENT -- IN THIS FOLLOW-UP.

              8          Q.      IT SAYS, "ONCE THIS ISSUE WAS RESOLVED, THE

              9    MANAGING MEMBERS AGREED THAT MR. SPEAKMAN SHOULD RECEIVE

             10    THE PROPOSED CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

             11    OPERATING AGREEMENT OF THE LLC."

             12          DID THAT HAPPEN?

             13          A.      AGAIN, THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION POINTS ON

             14    THE -- ON THE RISK THAT I HAD.  IT WAS -- WE AGREED TO A

             15    LOAN TO KEEP THE BUSINESS GOING.  I WAS IN AGREEMENT WITH

             16    THE ADDITIONAL LOAN.  AT SOME TIME, I WANTED TO REVIEW

             17    THAT WITH HIM TO GO THROUGH THE ITEMS WHICH WOULD'VE

             18    DISCUSSED WHAT WE COULD HAVE SUBMITTED TO AUDREY.

             19    UNFORTUNATELY, WE DID NOT DO THAT.

             20          Q.      THEN IT SAYS, "MANAGING MEMBERS,

             21    BRIAN CAMERON AND MICHAEL SPEAKMAN, THEN SIGNED THE MEMBER

             22    CAPITAL CALL."

             23          DID THAT HAPPEN?

             24          A.      WE DID.

             25          Q.      OKAY.  THEN ITEM 3, IT SAYS, "MR. SPEAKMAN

             26    PRESENTED AN E-MAIL FROM MR. CAMERON, WHICH THERE WAS

             27    REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF

             28    WESTERLY WINE."






                                                                           51







              1          DID THAT HAPPEN?

              2          A.      NO, IT DID NOT.

              3          Q.      OKAY.  "THE LIST OF THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES

              4    OF THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF WESTERLY WINE WAS GIVEN TO

              5    MR. CAMERON, WHO ACKNOWLEDGED THE DOCUMENT SATISFIED HIS

              6    REQUEST.

              7          A.      THERE WAS TWO SECONDS ON THIS CONVERSATION.

              8    IT DIDN'T COME ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT I EXPECTED FROM THE

              9    MEETING.  SO WHEN I SAW THAT, SHOULD I HAVE DISPUTED IT

             10    THEN?  OF COURSE.  I DIDN'T THINK -- EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

             11    BASICALLY, I HAD A BUSINESS PARTNER WITH WHOM I CONTENT TO

             12    MOVE FORWARD.

             13          Q.      AND ITEM 4, IT SAYS, "MR. SPEAKMAN ANNOUNCED

             14    THAT HE WAS MEETING WITH THOMAS MAHONEY, THE ACCOUNTANT

             15    FOR WESTERLY WINE AT 10:00 A.M. ON TUESDAY, JUNE 5TH,

             16    2018, IN MR. MAHONEY'S OFFICE."

             17          DID THAT HAPPEN?

             18          A.      I DO NOT KNOW.  I DID NOT ATTEND, SO I DO

             19    NOT KNOW IF THAT HAPPENED OR NOT.

             20          Q.      OKAY.  AND, "MR. CAMERON EXPRESSED AN

             21    INTEREST IN ATTENDING THE MEETING, SO THE OFFICE ADDRESS

             22    WAS PROVIDED."

             23          DID THAT HAPPEN?

             24          A.      WE HAD NO MORE COMMUNICATION AFTER THE

             25    MEETING, SO I DO NOT RECALL GOING TO THE MEETING.  NEVER.

             26    AND I DID NOT HAVE ANY FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATION WITH HIM AS

             27    TO THE TIME OR THE PLACE.

             28          MR. KATZMAN:  DONE WITH THIS ONE?

              1          MR. ARMSTRONG:  YEAH.

              2    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

              4    MARKING AS EXHIBIT 5.  TAKE A MOMENT.

              5          HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THIS DOCUMENT?

              6          (EXHIBIT 5 MARKED FOR IDENTIFICATION.)

              7          A.      I DID BRIEFLY AT THE MEETING.

              8          Q.      OKAY.  THIS DOCUMENT WAS PRESENTED TO YOU AT

             11    TO -- IT WAS JUST AT THE MEETING.

             12          Q.      OKAY.  SO THE FIRST TIME YOU SAW THE

             13    PROMISSORY NOTE WAS AT THE MEETING?

             14          A.      YES, SIR.

             15          Q.      OKAY.  AND THAT WAS THIS DOCUMENT YOU'RE

              4          A.      WE NEVER DISCUSSED A PROMISSORY NOTE.  WE

              5    DISCUSSED THAT HE WOULD HAVE A PREFERRED INTEREST ON HIS

              6    LOAN.

              7          Q.      AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN "HAVE A PREFERRED

              8    INTEREST ON HIS LOAN"?

              9          A.      HE WAS BORROWING MONEY FROM HIS CHARLES

             10    SCHWAB ACCOUNT, AND BASICALLY WHATEVER IT WAS PER ANNUM,

             11    HE WANTED THE SAME RETURN IN ORDER TO INVEST IN THE

             12    COMPANY.  SO HIS MONEY WAS PROTECTED BY THE ASSETS OF THE

             12          MR. KATZMAN:  DID YOU TESTIFY YOU NEVER SAW THIS?

             14    FIRST TIME I'M SEEING THIS COPY.

             15          MR. KATZMAN:  SO ARE YOU ASKING HIM ABOUT THE

             16    DOCUMENT, OR ARE YOU ASKING HIM WHAT'S FIRST -- HIS

             17    UNDERSTANDING OF FIRST FOUNDATION?

             18          MR. ARMSTRONG:  FIRST FOUNDATION.  THAT'S A

             19    FOUNDATIONAL QUESTION, SO I'M GOING TO START AT IT.

             20          THE WITNESS:  I DON'T KNOW.

             21    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             22          Q.      HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF FIRST FOUNDATION?

             23          A.      I DON'T KNOW.

             24          Q.      IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU EACH PUT

             25    $5,000 OF INITIAL CAPITAL INTO WESTERLY WINE TO START THE

             26    BUSINESS?

              1    BY CHECK THAT MICHAEL SPEAKMAN MADE TO WESTERLY WINE?

              2          A.      I WAS NOT.

              3          Q.      OKAY.  AND WHAT ABOUT THE 260,000 WIRE FROM

              4    HIS SWAB ACCOUNT?

              5          A.      THAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TRANSACTION TO

              6    GIVE IT TO -- TO COVER THE INVENTORY FOR THEM.  I HAVE NOT

              7    SEEN THIS FORM, SO I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS IN FRONT

              8    OF ME.  SO I WOULD BE SAYING -- I WOULD BE LYING.  I DON'T

              9    KNOW.

             10          Q.      OKAY.  AND, REALLY, I'M JUST ASKING WHAT

             14    DISCUSSED WITH WESTERLY.  SO, THEREFORE, THESE MUST BE THE

             15    PAYMENTS MADE TO THE CROWN POINT.  I'M ONLY ASSUMING THIS

             16    BASED ON THE DOLLAR AMOUNT.

             17          Q.      OKAY.  SO THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT ADDS UP TO

             18    THE AMOUNT OF THE PROMISSORY NOTE?

             19          A.      OKAY.

             20          Q.      RIGHT?  YOU'D AGREE WITH THAT?

             21          MR. KATZMAN:  THE TOTAL BEARING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

             22    PAGE?

             23          MR. ARMSTRONG:  FOR THE LOAN, YES, BECAUSE HE SAID

             24    WHEN HE --

             25          MR. KATZMAN:  FOR WHAT HE CHARACTERIZES AS A LOAN.

             10    MICHAEL SPEAKMAN?

             11          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECTION.  FORM OF THE QUESTION.

             15    IS THAT -- I DON'T WANT TO MISCHARACTERIZE IT.

             16          A.      BASED ON CONVERSATIONS, E-MAIL, YES, IT WAS

             17    A LOAN.

             18          Q.      OKAY.  I'M HANDING YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO

             24    REP FOR WESTERLY WINE, AND IT TALKS ABOUT A NUMBER OF

             25    ACCOUNTS.  WERE YOU AWARE AT ANY TIME HOW MANY ACCOUNTS

             26    MICHAEL SPEAKMAN HAD?

              1          A.      I HAD AN IDEA.  HE RECAPPED WITH ME WHAT HE

              2    WAS DOING.

              3          Q.      OKAY.  DOES THE 13 NUMBER SOUND ABOUT

              4    ACCURATE?

              5          A.      IT SOUNDS VERY LOW.

              6          Q.      OKAY.  BUT IT'S IN THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY?

              7          A.      I GUESS.

              8          MR. KATZMAN:  DON'T -- DON'T GUESS.

              9          THE WITNESS:  REALM OF POSSIBILITY, YES.

             12    FOUR ACCOUNTS; IS THAT ACCURATE?

             13          A.      THAT IS NOT ACCURATE.

             14          Q.      HOW MANY ACCOUNTS DO YOU THINK YOU HAD WITH

             15    WESTERLY WINE?

             16          A.      WELL, PRIOR TO -- THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE

             17    PRIOR TO THE SALE THAT ARE CONTINUED ACCOUNTS.  THERE'D BE

             18    WELL OVER 40 ACCOUNTS THAT COLIN AND MYSELF BROUGHT TO THE

             19    COMPANY THAT ARE -- THAT ARE EXISTING BUSINESSES PRIOR TO

             20    THE SALE.

             22    ACCOUNTS ANYWHERE?

             24          Q.      ALL RIGHT.  TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE YOU

              5    BROUGHT THREE ACCOUNTS.

              6          DOES THAT SOUND ACCURATE?

              7          A.      THAT SOUNDS ACCURATE.

              8          Q.      AND WHAT ABOUT CHUCK HERRALD?

              1    REPRESENT TO YOU THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS DOCUMENT WAS

              2    GENERATED FOR.  AS FAR AS, LIKE, FRIENDS AND FAMILY

              3    ACCOUNTS, DID THE -- THE NUMBERS LOOK ABOUT ACCURATE TO

              4    YOU, OR DO YOU THINK THEY'RE OFF?

              5          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECT TO THE FORM OF THE QUESTION.

              6    NO FOUNDATION.

              7          THE WITNESS:  YEAH.  THERE'S -- HE HAS A FORM THAT

              8    WE USUALLY PRINT OUT TO SHOW WHO DID WHAT.  SECONDLY,

              9    100 PERCENT OF COLIN'S ACCOUNTS WERE MY ACCOUNTS.  I GAVE

             10    THEM TO COLIN SO HE CAN BE PAID A COMMISSION.

             11    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             12          Q.      SO YOU HAD 25 ACCOUNTS.  SO ASSUMING --

             13          A.      40 OF THOSE ACCOUNTS -- EVERY -- EVERY

             14    ACCOUNT THAT COLIN HAD UNDER HOUSE ACCOUNT, AND FRIENDS

             15    AND FAMILY WERE ASSOCIATES OF MINE.

             16          Q.      OKAY.  WHAT ABOUT MARK BERNSTEIN?

             17          A.      THOSE ARE HIS FRIENDS.

             18          Q.      ALL RIGHT.

             19          A.      THIS IS ALSO TO NOTE THROUGH APRIL.  SO THIS

             20    IS THE FIRST FIVE OF -- FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF BUSINESS.

             21    AFTER THAT, WE DID NOT PURSUE IT AFTER MAY 1.

             22          Q.      YOU DIDN'T PURSUE FRIENDS AND FAMILY?

             23          A.      MICHAEL SPEAKMAN THREATENED ME, SO I SAID

             24    THERE WAS NO REASON TO GO OUT AND PRESENT THE BRAND WHEN I

             25    WAS BEING THREATENED.

             26          Q.      AND WHEN YOU SAY HE THREATENED YOU, WHEN --

             27    WHEN WAS IT THAT HE THREATENED YOU, BEST YOU CAN RECALL?

             28          A.      I DON'T RECALL THE EXACT DATE.  I CAN GO






                                                                           62







              1    BACK AND RESEARCH THE -- THE E-MAIL AND THE CONVERSATION.

              2    TWICE AT THE GYM, BASICALLY.  IT WAS AT THE --

              3          Q.      OKAY.

              4          A.      IT WAS A VERBAL ASSAULT --

              5          Q.      OKAY.

              6          A.      -- ON COLIN AND MYSELF.

              7          Q.      COLIN WAS AT THE GYM --

              8          A.      NO, IT WAS BASICALLY ABOUT COLIN.

              9          Q.      OKAY.  AND YOU SAID IT WAS A VERBAL ASSAULT.

             10    AS BEST YOU CAN RECALL -- IF YOU KNOW, LIKE, WHAT WERE THE

             11    EXACT WORDS THAT HE USED, AS BEST YOU CAN RECALL?

             12          A.      BASICALLY, THAT COLIN WAS DOING ZERO WORK,

             13    THAT MY TRIP OUT TO LAS VEGAS WAS WORTHLESS, AND THAT I

             14    DIDN'T GENERATE ONE CASE OF SALE IN THE WEEK.  HE BECAME

             15    VERY, VERY, VERY ARGUMENTATIVE AND VERY, VERY DESTRUCTIVE.

             16    I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.  IT WAS --

             17          Q.      YOU WERE SURPRISED?

             18          A.      NOT ONLY SURPRISED.  I WAS FLOORED.

             19          Q.      AND THIS WAS IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF

             20    BUSINESS?

             21          A.      THIS WAS AFTER FOUR MONTHS OF BUSINESS AND

             22    THINGS WERE GOING WELL.  AND IN THE SECOND TURN OF THE

             23    BUSINESS, HIS BEHAVIOR CHANGED -- AFTER FIVE -- FIFTH

             24    MONTH INTO THE BUSINESS, HIS BEHAVIOR CHANGED

             25    DRAMATICALLY.

             26          Q.      OKAY.  AND THIS WAS IN 2018?

             27          A.      THIS WAS IN 2018, YES.

             28          Q.      DO YOU KNOW WHAT IMPERIAL WAREHOUSE IS?






                                                                           63







              1          A.      IT'S A WAREHOUSE UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

              2    ACTUALLY, OUTSIDE OF SANTA YNEZ.

              3          Q.      TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE YOU EVER BUSINESS

              4    WITH IMPERIAL WAREHOUSE?

              5          A.      PRIOR TO THIS, NO.  THEY HELD THE INVENTORY

              6    FOR THE WESTERLY CASES.

              7          Q.      SO IT'S LIKE WINE STORAGE?

              8          A.      YES.

              9          Q.      SO HANDING YOU A DOCUMENT, WHICH I'M GOING

             10    TO MARK AS DEFENSE EXHIBIT 10.  AND IT LISTS A DATE AND

             11    THEN "BY."

             12          DO YOU HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS?

             13          (EXHIBIT 10 MARKED FOR IDENTIFICATION.)

             14          A.      I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE.

             15          Q.      OKAY.  DO YOU KNOW HOW IMPERIAL WAREHOUSE IN

             16    SANTA MARIA TRACKS ITS DOCUMENTS -- OR TRACKS ITS

             17    INVENTORY?

             18          A.      I DO NOT.

             19          Q.      OKAY.  WELL, YOU MENTIONED BEFORE THAT YOU

             20    USED THEIR WINE STORAGE.  DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OR

             21    UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW THEY TRACK THE WINE STORAGE THERE

             22    AT IMPERIAL WAREHOUSE?

             23          A.      THROUGH AUTOMATED INVENTORY COUNT.  YOU GET

             24    A MONTHLY UPDATE.

             25          Q.      DO THESE DATES HAVE ANY MEANING TO YOU AT

             26    ALL?

             27          A.      THEY HAVE NO MEANING TO ME WHATSOEVER.

             28          Q.      OKAY.  I'M GOING TO HAND YOU WHAT'S MARKED






                                                                           64







              1    AS EXHIBIT 11.  IT'S REFERENCING DELIVERY AND SHIPMENT OF

              2    WESTERLY WINE, AND WHO THEY'RE ASSOCIATED WITH.

              3          DO YOU KNOW HOW THESE REPORTS ARE GENERATED OR HOW

              4    THEY WERE GENERATED BY WESTERLY WINE WHEN YOU WERE

              5    INVOLVED IN THE BUSINESS?

              6          (EXHIBIT 11 MARKED FOR IDENTIFICATION.)

              7          A.      WELL, IT MAKES SENSE.  DELIVERY MEANS THAT

              8    MIKE DELIVERED CASES TO AND FROM AN ACCOUNT.  SO IT'S

              9    PRETTY BLACK AND WHITE.  MIKE -- MICHAEL SPEAKMAN WENT ON

             10    RECORD NUMEROUS TIMES.  "I LOVED THIS PART OF THE

             11    BUSINESS.  YOU SELL.  I'LL DELIVER.  BRING IN MORE

             12    BUSINESS.  I LOVE THIS PART OF BUSINESS."  SO, THEREFORE,

             13    HE DELIVERED A LOT OF CASES FOR US INSTEAD OF HIRING --

             14    HIRING A SERVICE TO DO IT.  HE LOVED DOING IT.

             15          Q.      SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S --

             16          A.      DISCREPANCIES?

             17          Q.      DISPARITY BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF CASES YOU

             18    DELIVERED VERSUS MIKE --

             19          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECTION.  LACK OF FOUNDATION.

             20          THE WITNESS HAS TESTIFIED THAT MICHAEL SPEAKMAN DID

             21    MOST OF THE DELIVERY RATHER THAN USING A SERVICE, WHICH

             22    WOULD EXPLAIN WHY HE WOULD HAVE MORE DELIVERIES THAN

             23    ANYBODY ELSE.  IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THAT

             24    THIS -- THIS DOCUMENT ACCURATELY REFLECTS DELIVERIES.

             25          MR. ARMSTRONG:  THAT WASN'T MY QUESTION.  THAT WAS

             26    NOT MY QUESTION.

             27          MR. KATZMAN:  SO WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?

             28    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:






                                                                           65







              1          Q.      MY QUESTION WAS --

              2          MR. KATZMAN:  REPHRASE.

              3    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

              4          Q.      MY QUESTION WAS, BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE

              5    WITH MICHAEL SPEAKMAN, WOULD THE -- WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY

              6    DISCREPANCY -- BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF

              7    DELIVERIES THAT WE LOOKED AT THE BUSINESS RECORDS, SHOWING

              8    HOW MANY DELIVERIES MICHAEL SPEAKMAN MADE VERSUS YOURSELF,

              9    THAT MICHAEL SPEAKMAN WOULD SHOW THAT HE DID MORE

             10    DELIVERIES BECAUSE HE DID A LOT OF THE DELIVERIES

             11    HIMSELF --

             12          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECTION.

             13    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             14          Q.      -- TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE?

             15          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECTION.

             16          THE WITNESS:  WE NEVER GOT -- HE LOVED DELIVERING

             17    PRODUCTS.  THAT WAS -- ONE OF HIS PASSIONS WAS DELIVERING

             18    PRODUCT.

             19    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             20          Q.      WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU WERE

             21    INVOLVED WITH THE BUSINESS, THAT MICHAEL SPEAKMAN

             22    DELIVERED MORE WINE THAN YOU DID FOR THE BUSINESS?

             23          A.      HE CHOSE TO DO THAT.

             24          Q.      THAT WASN'T MY QUESTION, THOUGH.  MY

             25    QUESTION WAS, IS IT A TRUE STATEMENT THAT WHEN YOU WERE

             26    INVOLVED WITH WESTERLY WINE, THAT MICHAEL SPEAKMAN --

             27          A.      I HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE INVENTORY.  SO,

             28    THEREFORE, I COULD NOT DELIVER IT.






                                                                           66







              1          Q.      OKAY.  THAT STILL ISN'T THE QUESTION.  THE

              2    QUESTION IS ASKING YOU ABOUT THE FOUNDATIONAL FACT THAT

              3    YOU WOULD AGREE FOR THE REASONS YOU STATED BEFORE THAT

              4    MICHAEL SPEAKMAN DELIVERED MORE WESTERLY WINE THAN YOU

              5    DID?

              6          A.      SURE.

              7          Q.      I'M HANDING YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO MARK AS

              8    DEFENSE EXHIBIT 12.

              9          HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS DOCUMENT BEFORE?

             10          (EXHIBIT 12 MARKED FOR IDENTIFICATION.)

             11          A.      I HAVE NOT.

             12          Q.      OKAY.  THIS PURPORTS TO BE A LIST OF WINE

             13    EVENTS AND TASTING.

             14          (REPORTER CLARIFICATION.)

             15    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             16          Q.      IT'S WINE EVENTS AND TASTING FOR WESTERLY

             17    WINE.  AND TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, WAS COLIN MCPHEE INVOLVED IN

             18    AN EVENT CALLED FISH FOR LIFE AT DANA POINT WHERE THERE

             19    WAS A WESTERLY WINE TASTING?

             20          A.      YES.

             21          Q.      AND DID HE DO THAT WITH MICHAEL SPEAKMAN?

             22          A.      I THINK SO.

             23          Q.      NEXT EVENT ON THIS LIST IS -- IF I BUTCHER

             24    THE NAME I APOLOGIZE.

             25          A.      BARROW.

             26          Q.      BARROW WINE BAR SAN CLEMENTE.

             27          IS THAT A WINE TASTING EVENT THAT MICHAEL SPEAKMAN

             28    DID WITH BRIAN CAMERON?






                                                                           67







              1          A.      THE FIRST AND THE LAST, YES.

              2          Q.      OKAY.  AND DO YOU KNOW WHEN THAT WAS?

              3          A.      I DO NOT RECALL.

              4          Q.      OKAY.  THE NEXT ONE, IT SAYS -- AGAIN I

              5    MIGHT NOT GET THE NAME RIGHT.

              6          A.      BACARA.

              7          Q.      BACARA RESORTS IN SANTA BARBARA.  IS THAT A

              8    WINE TASTING EVENT THAT COLIN DID WITH MICHAEL SPEAKMAN?

              9          A.      THAT WAS SETUP BY ME, BUT THEY WENT UP AND

             10    SPENT THE NIGHT.  IT WAS MORE OF A TREAT FOR THEM SO, YES.

             11          Q.      OKAY.  AND THEN THE ORIGINAL WINE CLUB IN

             12    SANTA ANA, THERE'S -- IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A WINE TASTING

             13    EVENT WITH MICHAEL SPEAKMAN AND COLIN?

             14          A.      COLIN SET IT AND BROUGHT MIKE WITH HIM TO

             15    TRAIN HIM ON WINE.

             16          Q.      OKAY.  SO THE ORIGINAL WINE CLUB DOES WINE

             17    TASTING?

             18          A.      THEY DO.

             19          Q.      OKAY.  AND DO YOU KNOW WHERE IN SANTA ANA

             20    THEY -- THEY DO THAT?

             21          A.      RIGHT OFF AT THE RESTAURANT -- AT THEIR

             22    RETAIL PLACE, OFF OF -- I THINK IT WAS JUST OFF MAIN IN

             23    SANTA ANA.  THEY HAVE A WINE LICENSE AND A WINE BAR.

             24          Q.      AND IT'S CALLED THE ORIGINAL WINE CLUB?

             25          A.      YES, SIR.

             26          Q.      OKAY.  AND THEN LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS TWO

             27    OTHER EVENTS THAT MICHAEL SPEAKMAN ATTENDED.

             28          DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE WITH THAT?






                                                                           68

              7          A.      MICHAEL SPEAKMAN.

              8          Q.      CECCCO.  DID YOU HEAR OF THIS CECCCO

              9    RESTORANTE?

             10          A.      I HAVE NOT.  IT'S NOT LISTED -- IT'S NOT

             11    LISTED HERE.  THERE ARE A LOT OF EVENTS THAT I DID ON MY

             12    OWN THAT ARE NOT LISTED HERE.

             13          Q.      OKAY.  DO YOU RECALL THE NAME OF THOSE

             14    EVENTS?

             15          A.      I CAN RECAP THOSE ON A LATER DATE.

             16          Q.      OKAY.  DO YOU RECALL ABOUT HOW MANY EVENTS

             17    YOU DID?

             18          A.      I CAN'T RECALL.  I'LL GO THROUGH MY NOTES.

             19          Q.      NOW, YOU MENTIONED BEFORE THAT

             20    MICHAEL SPEAKMAN OFFERED TO BUY YOU OUT OF -- OF WESTERLY

             21    WINE, BUT HIS OFFER WAS TOO LOW.  WHAT -- WHAT DO YOU

             22    BELIEVE IS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF WESTERLY WINE?

             23          MR. KATZMAN:  I WANT TO OBJECT TO THE FORM OF THE

             24    QUESTION AS OF WHEN.

             25          MR. ARMSTRONG:  RIGHT.

             26    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             27          Q.      OKAY.  WE'LL -- WE'LL BREAK IT -- WE'LL

             28    BREAKDOWN MY QUESTION.






                                                                           71







              1          A.      PLEASE.

              2          Q.      OKAY.  WHAT DO YOU PRESENTLY BELIEVE IS THE

              3    FAIR MARKET VALUE OF --

              4          A.      I WOULD HAVE NO -- I HAVE NOT SEEN THE

              5    BOOKS.  I COULDN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU THE FAIR MARKET VALUE

              6    OF THE COMPANY RIGHT NOW.

              7          Q.      OKAY.  WHEN YOU WERE LAST INVOLVED WITH

              8    WESTERLY WINE -- WHEN I SAY INVOLVED, YOU WERE GETTING

              9    ALONG WITH MICHAEL SPEAKMAN BEFORE YOUR RELATIONSHIP

             10    SOURED -- WHAT DID YOU BELIEVE THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF

             11    WESTERLY WINE WAS AT THAT TIME?

             12          A.      MY OPINION OF FAIR MARKET VALUE AND A TRUE

             13    ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.  SO I

             14    WOULD SPECULATE -- I WOULD JUST BE SPECULATING OF WHAT I

             15    THOUGHT THE VALUE WAS --

             16          Q.      OKAY.

             17          A.      I'M ASKING FOR A THIRD PARTY.

             18          Q.      SURE.

             19          AND THE REASON I'M ASKING THIS QUESTION THIS WAY IS

             20    THAT YOU, AS A PART OWN OF THE BUSINESS, HAVE A RIGHT TO

             21    TESTIFY ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK THE VALUE IS.  AND YOU DON'T

             22    HAVE TO ANSWER MY QUESTION.

             23          I'M JUST GOING TO CAUTION YOU THAT IF I ASK YOU NOW

             24    FOR A FAIR MARKET EVALUATION AND YOU DON'T GIVE ME A

             25    VALUE, AND YOU WANT TO HIRE AN EXPERT, THAT'S FINE.  BUT

             26    THEN THAT GIVES ME THE RIGHT TO MOVE TO PRECLUDE YOU FROM

             27    LATER OFFERING OPINION BECAUSE I'M HERE -- NOW I'M ASKING

             28    YOU THESE QUESTIONS.






                                                                           72







              1          A.      BASED ON THE FIRST -- BASED ON THE FIRST

              2    TRANCHE OF PURCHASE AND LOAN AND BASED ON THE EXISTING

              3    INVENTORY, I VALUE THE COMPANY AT WELL OVER HALF A MILLION

              4    DOLLARS BASE ON ASSETS WITHOUT EXCLUDING THE INTRINSIC

              5    VALUE OF WHAT THE WESTERLY NAME MEANT AFTER 9 YEARS --

              6    12 YEARS IN THE BUSINESS ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY,

              7    THE WINEMAKER, AND THE MARKETING THAT WENT TO IT.  SO

              8    THAT'S WHY I COULD NOT COME UP WITH A VALUATION WHAT THE

              9    INTRINSIC VALUE IS.

             10          MR. KATZMAN:  OKAY.  AND THIS IS WHERE -- AND I

             11    AGREE WHERE YOU'RE GOING, BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT

             12    YOUR PRECISION.

             13          WHEN YOU SAY IT WAS WORTH HALF A MILLION, ARE YOU

             14    TALKING ABOUT HALF A MILLION EQUITY OR HALF A MILLION --

             15    OR HALF A MILLION TOTAL VALUE WITH THE LOAN?

             16          MR. ARMSTRONG:  NO.  WHAT HE SAID -- WHAT HE SAID

             17    WAS --

             18          THE WITNESS:  THE VALUE -- WELL OVER -- THE VALUE OF

             19    THE COMPANY -- HOW YOU -- HOW YOU DETERMINE THE VALUE OF

             20    THE COMPANY?  I WAS LOOKING AT ASSETS -- INVENTORY,

             21    BASICALLY, ON THE SALES OF NET PROFITS.

             22    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             23          Q.      RIGHT.

             24          A.      SO VALUATIONS WOULD DIFFER THAN WHAT

             25    BASICALLY THE CAPITAL VALUE OF THE COMPANY IS JUST BASED

             26    ON INVENTORY.  SO, THEREFORE, JUST BASED ON EXISTING

             27    INVENTORY WITH $1 MILLION OF INVENTORY THAT WE HAD

             28    PURCHASED, I VALUE -- I VALUE THAT INVENTORY AT X, LESS --






                                                                           73







              1    WHAT THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY WOULD BE LESS EVERYTHING

              2    ELSE.  THAT'S JUST -- THAT WAS MY VISION OR THAT WAS MY

              3    OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY.

              4          Q.      OKAY.  SO YOU BELIEVE THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE

              5    BUSINESS IS $1 MILLION, BEST ESTIMATION?

              6          A.      I WOULD SAY MINIMUM.

              7          Q.      OKAY.

              8          MR. KATZMAN:  AS OF THE -- BEFORE THE SECOND LOAN?

              9          THE WITNESS:  YES.  THE MULTIPLES.

             10    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             11          Q.      OKAY.  WHAT DID YOU BELIEVE THE BUSINESS WAS

             12    AT THE TIME YOU STARTED WITH MR. SPEAKMAN?

             13          MR. KATZMAN:  I'M SORRY.  OBJECT TO THE FORM OF THE

             14    QUESTION.

             15    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             16          Q.      WELL, YOU MENTIONED THAT WHEN YOU GOT

             17    INVOLVED WITH THE BUSINESS, YOU KNOW, BASED ON THE ASSETS

             18    AND HOW BUSINESS WAS BEING RUN, YOU BELIEVE THE BUSINESS

             19    IS WORTH AT LEAST $1 MILLION BEFORE YOU AND MR. SPEAKMAN

             20    HAD A FALLING OUT.

             21          AND I'M ASKING IS, IS YOUR ASSESSMENT AS FAR AS THE

             22    VALUE OR OPINION REGARDING VALUE ANY DIFFERENT THAN WHEN

             23    YOU FIRST JOINED THE COMPANY AND PUT THAT INITIAL $5,000?

             24          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECT TO THE QUESTION.  MISSTATES

             25    WHAT HE SAID.  HE SAID IT WAS $1 MILLION AS OF THE FIRST

             26    PURCHASE, NOT -- THE FALLING OUT OCCURRED AFTER THAT --

             27    AFTER THAT.

             28          BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING HIM, WHAT DID YOU -- IF YOU'RE






                                                                           74







              1    ASKING HIM, WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE THE VALUE OF WESTERLY WINE

              2    WAS BEFORE ANY PURCHASES OCCURRED AND YOU ACQUIRED THE

              3    COMPANY?  I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE'S ASKING YOU.

              4          MR. ARMSTRONG:  YEAH.

              5          THE WITNESS:  THE VALUE PRIOR TO?

              6    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

              7          Q.      YES.

              8          A.      JUST SO MANY DIFFERENT ANSWERS.  YOU CAN'T

              9    REALLY --

             10          Q.      ALL RIGHT.  LET ME ASK YOU THIS:  DO YOU

             11    KNOW HOW MUCH YOU AND MR. SPEAKMAN PURCHASED WESTERLY WINE

             12    FROM MR. ROGER BOWER?  WHAT THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS WHEN

             13    YOU BOUGHT IT FROM HIM?

             14          A.      600- -- I THINK WITH THE ORIGINAL PROMISSORY

             15    NOTE, 652,000 ESTIMATED.

             16          Q.      AND THAT WAS THE PROMISSORY NOTE DOCUMENT WE

             17    LOOKED AT FROM MR. SPEAKMAN -- THAT WAS TO BUY THE

             18    BUSINESS FROM MR. ROGER BOWER?

             19          A.      UH-HUH.

             20          Q.      "YES"?

             21          A.      YES.

             22          Q.      OKAY.  AND YOU BELIEVE SOON AFTER THAT THERE

             23    WERE WINE PURCHASES MAKING THE VALUE OF AT LEAST $1

             24    MILLION, THAT THERE WAS ADDITIONAL ASSETS IN THE BUSINESS;

             25    OR DID I -- DID I MISUNDERSTAND THAT?

             26          A.      YOUR QUESTION IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER.

              3    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

              4          Q.      SO AFTER THE $652,000 PAYMENT TO

              5    ROGER BOWER, DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OTHER CAPITAL WAS PUT IN

              6    TO BUY WINE TO -- AS TO THE ASSETS?

              7          A.      NONE AFTER THAT.

              8          Q.      OKAY.  WHAT -- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE $425,000

              9    THAT MR. SPEAKMAN CLAIMS WAS A CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION AND

             10    YOU CLAIM WAS A LOAN?  WHAT THAT MONEY WAS -- WHAT THOSE

             17          A.      I NEVER SAW THE FINAL NUMBER.

             18          Q.      AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT TYPES OF VARIETIES WERE

             19    PURCHASED.

             20          A.      I HAVE AN IDEA BASED ON CONVERSATIONS.  I

             21    NEVER SAW THE FINAL NUMBER.

             22          Q.      ALL RIGHT.  AND I JUST -- I JUST, KIND OF,

             23    WANT TO RECAP.  YOU KNOW, IT'S, KIND OF, BEEN A LONG DAY.

             24          WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU'VE TOLD ME, AS FAR

             25    AS YOU CAN RECALL, AS YOU SIT HERE TODAY, EVERY

             26    CONVERSATION YOU CAN RECALL ABOUT THE $425,000 THAT

             27    MR. SPEAKMAN PUT INTO WESTERLY WINE?

             28          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECTION.  FORM OF THE QUESTION.  IT






                                                                           76

              4          Q.      LET ME REPHRASE IT THIS WAY:  AS BEST YOU

              5    RECALL, CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT EXACT WORDS MICHAEL SPEAKMAN

              6    USED WHEN SPEAKING TO YOU, WHETHER IN WRITING OR VERBALLY,

              7    ABOUT WHY ANOTHER $425,000 WAS GOING TO BE PUT INTO

              8    WESTERLY WINE TO PURCHASE WINE?

              9          A.      THE WINE BECAME AVAILABLE FROM THE WINERY.

             10          Q.      OKAY.  THAT WAS FROM CROWN POINT?

             11          A.      YES.

             12          MR. KATZMAN:  CAN WE TAKE A BREAK FOR A SECOND?

             13          MR. ARMSTRONG:  SURE.

             14

             15          (A RECESS IS TAKEN.)

             16

             17          MR. ARMSTRONG:  BACK ON THE RECORD.

             18    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             19          Q.      YOU MENTIONED BEFORE THAT THE $425,000, IT

             20    WAS YOUR UNDERSTANDING, THAT WAS A LOAN?

             21          A.      YES.

             22          Q.      OKAY.  AT ANY POINT IN TIME, WERE YOU GIVEN

             23    A PROMISSORY NOTE OR A DOCUMENT ENTITLED PROMISSORY NOTE

             24    OR LOAN DOCUMENT REGARDING -- IN THE AMOUNT FOR $425,000

             25    FROM MR. SPEAKMAN?

             26          A.      I THOUGHT THAT WAS FORTHCOMING.

             27          Q.      BUT YOU NEVER SAW ONE?

             28          A.      I DID NOT.






                                                                           77







              1          Q.      AND THE ONLY PROMISSORY NOTE DOCUMENT THAT

              2    YOU ACTUALLY HAD SEEN WAS FOR $425,000, CORRECT?

              3          A.      CORRECT.  SEVEN MONTHS -- EIGHT MONTHS AFTER

              4    WE FORMED THE BUSINESS.

              5          Q.      NOW, AGAIN, YOU MENTIONED BEFORE THAT YOU

              6    HAD VERBAL DISCUSSIONS WITH MICHAEL SPEAKMAN THAT THE

              7    $425,000 ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO BUY WINE FROM CROWN POINT

              8    WAS GOING TO BE A LOAN.  AS BEST AS YOU CAN RECALL, WHAT

              9    ARE THE EXACT WORDS -- AS BEST AS YOU CAN REMEMBER -- THAT

             10    HE USED THAT MADE THE IMPRESSION UPON YOU THAT A SECOND

             11    LOAN WAS GOING TO BE MADE?

             12          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECT TO THE FORM OF THE QUESTION.

             13          THE WITNESS:  THERE WAS AN E-MAIL -- BASICALLY,

             14    RECAPPED OUR MEETING WITH A CONVERSATION WITH HIS WIFE

             15    THAT HE WOULD LOAN THE MONEY TO THE COMPANY TO KEEP THE

             16    BRAND GOING, AND HE COMPLIMENTED ME AND THEN BLAH, BLAH,

             17    BLAH ABOUT THE BUSINESS AND KEEPING THE BRAND GOING.

             18          SO IN GOOD FAITH, HE WANTED TO KEEP THE BUSINESS

             19    GOING, AND SO DID I.  AS I SAID, AGAIN, I WANTED NOT TO BE

             20    DILUTED IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM IN THE COMPANY.

             21    BY MR. ARMSTRONG:

             22          Q.      ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU CAN RECALL?

             23          A.      NO.

             24          MR. KATZMAN:  OBJECT TO THE FORM OF THE QUESTION.

             25          MR. ARMSTRONG:  OKAY.  I THINK THAT'S ALL THE

             26    QUESTIONS I HAVE.  MR. KATZMAN MAY HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

             27          MR. KATZMAN:  YEAH, I DO.  IT'S ACTUALLY A FOLLOW UP

             28    ON YOUR QUESTION.






                                                                           78

              7          Q.      OKAY.  DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION AS TO WHAT THE

              8    VALUE OF THAT WINE WOULD BE BASED UPON YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND

              9    EXPERIENCE -- IF IT HAD BEEN PROPERLY MARKETED AND

             10    MONETIZED?
