THE COURT REPORTER: Please raise your right
hand to be sworn.
Do you solemnly state under penalty of perjury
that the testimony you will give in this matter will be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
THE WITNESS: I do.

this is an unusual communication event because as you
see we've have a court reporting taking things down, and
even though we're at my office, the testimony you give
is like you were giving testimony in a court of law.
And so there may be opportunities for portions of your
testimony to be read or whatnot and used as evidence in
trial. That's for the lawyers to deal with. That does
not really concern you so much, but I'm trying to give
you an idea of the importance of your testimony and to
be accurate as you possibly can. In these communication
events called depositions it's a little bit unusual.
Normal conversations people tend to talk over one
another because sometimes you can anticipate what
somebody is saying before they finish their question and
you might start answering, but as you see we have the
court reporter here who has the difficult job of trying
to accurately record any time anybody speaks. So it's
really important if someone is asking a question whether
it's me or the lawyer sitting next to you asking the
question, let us finish first and then answer. And it's
okay to take a moment to think about the question even
if you think you know the answer. That's fine too.
This isn't a memory test in the sense that you may -­
very few people I've ever met have perfect recall about
anything.

A	Yes.
Q	But so don't feel bad if you don't recall a
specific date, but if you do have a specific
recollection, whenever you have a specific recollection
about a date, time, or place or people or what words
were used, that would be our preference for you to tell
us that. And then if you don't have a specific
recollection, but a general recollection, like, well
this was around fall, you know, and something happened,
try to get as accurate as you can as best you can
remember it.

A
Q
A
Q

Okay.
And that's fine.
Okay.
Also, what's really important 1s the questions

and answers have to be audible meaning that a lot of
times I'd ask	I might ask you a question in normal
conversation, and you might nod your head. And I would
take that based on the direction of your head nod goes
up and down, I would probably say, oh, you're agreeing.
If it's side to side, you disagree, but the court
reporter really can't accurately record the head nods so
it's important to say yes or no if it's a yes or no
question, if that's the answer that you want to give.
A	I see.

Q	All right. So and you always want to make sure
she can hear you whenever you answer a question.
A	Oh, sure.
Q	Makes her job a little easier even though I
think our court reporter will tell you to speak up if
she couldn't hear you.
A	Sure.
Q	But just have that in mind. So what brings us
here today is about a business called Shinderman Cafe.'
Have you ever heard of that business before?

A
Q

Yes.
And I'd just like to ask a few background

questions about you before we get too much detail about
Shinderman Cafe. So where are you presently employed?

A
Q
A
Q
A
Q
A

Right now you need a company name?
Yeah, uh-huh.
Bodyflex, B-o-d-y-f-1-e-x, Sports. Yeah.
And where is that business?
In City of Walnut.
City of what?
City of Walnut, W-a-1-n-u-t, by Diamond Bar,

yeah.

Q
A
Q

Okay. And how long have you worked there?
Since last November.
And before that where did you work?

A	Before that I was working for Shinderman Cafe.
Q	Okay. And how long did you work for Shinderman
Cafe?
A	About seven months. Seven, eight months.
Eight months. I'm sorry.
Q	Eight months. Okay. And what did you do for
Shinderman Cafe?
A	I was a bookkeeping, and then later on I take
on the store manager job.
Q	And at what point did you take on the role of
store manager?

A
Q
A
Q
A
Q
A
Q
A
Q

At what point?
Yes.
Like...
As best you can recall?
Like what time?
Yeah, like what dates?
Maybe mid February.
Of 2018?
Sorry. Yeah, February 2018.
Now, while you worked there were you aware of

any issues regarding any odors or smells?

A

Q

I do.
What can you tell me about your experiences

there?

�.
A	From start working there I working with the
people and people start -- employees start letting me
know that there is issue with the odor smells. And then
doing the -- as times goes they would report me like
daily if there is issue or not issue.
MR. RONAY: Excuse me, Ms. Hanes, you're doing
very well but my hearing is not as good. Could you
speak up a little bit louder, please.
THE WITNESS: Sure. Okay.
MR. RONAY: Thank you.
BY MR. ARMSTRONG:
Q	All right. So you mentioned that while you
were working there the employees started complaining to
you daily about smells and odors?
A	Yeah.
Q	Now, did customers ever complain to you?
A	I was not present all the time, and then I did
not have a direct customer contact me.
Q	So where -- when you worked at Shinderman Cafe
did you work at Shinderman Cafe or some place else?
A	I worked at -- from home, and then any issues
I'll go to store to work.
Q	And how often would you say when you worked at
Shinderman Cafe that you actually visited the premises?
A	At least four days a week.

Q	Okay. So did you yourself ever experience any
of the smells or odors there at Shinderman Cafe?
A	I	did.
Q	How would you describe the odor?
A	It's strong -- it's noticeable. It's strong,
and unfortunately the location that odor coming out of
it
Q	Uh-huh.
A	-- it's right when you walk in the shop, right
underneath the front of the register.
Q	Now, you mentioned it was a strong odor and
noticeable. Would you say it was -- I take it it wasn't
a pleasant odor?
MR. RONAY: Can you allow her to answer the
question other than leading her, please. Objection.

Q

MR. ARMSTRONG: Sure.
Again, so how would you describe the odor on a

scale between a pleasant odor or a foul odor?

A
Q

It's a foul odor.
Okay. And when you were there were you aware

of any attempts to try to correct the odor problem?
A	I	started -- yes. When employees were telling
me when we try to start to fix the odor we were
contacting the landlord. And then the first thing I	was
talk to Mr. -- the landlord about would since he thinks

the drain at the bottom at the floor has issues so ask
us to put water to the drain daily to make sure that the
drain is cleared, and then also we were directed to turn
the air on at a certain -- turn air onto clear out the
odor.
Q	The air-conditioning?
A	The air-conditioning to clear the odor that the
instruction I was told and that I was directed the
employee to do that every day.

Q
A

Okay. And did that solve the odor issue? It did not. Also we -- before I was started

there's a project going on with attic fan.

Q
A

Uh-huh.
I'm not sure. Yes, it's attic fan to be

installed to help ventilating the odor issue. I was
dealing with that for -- dealing with that, yeah.
Q	And that's when before Shinderman Cafe moved 1n
or just around the time it moved in?
A	After moved in. When I was there, I was
dealing with the contractor to install the fan. Yeah.
That's the project I was dealing with.
Q	Okay. And do you know if that contractor was
hired by the landlord or Shinderman Cafe?

A
Q

It -- I don't recall. Okay.

A	I just had the contact info, and they come in
to install and pay the bills.
Q	Okay. So with this project regarding the attic
fan did the attic fan ever get installed to your
knowledge?

A
Q
A
Q
A

Yeah, it did get installed. Did it help with the odor? I don't think so.
Why don't you think so?
The smell still there. We try to -- we turn on

the attic fan, the odor still didn't go away.
Q	Okay. All right. And when did you stop
working for Shinderman Cafe?

A
Q

August 1, 2018.
Okay. And did you -- I just need to get a

little more background questions. Did you ever go to
college or anything?

A
Q
A

to 2000	my daughter was born 2000 -- about 1998.
Q	Did you work for him at any time before you
worked at Shinderman Cafe?

A
Q

No.
And how did it come about that Mr. Huang asked

you to work for him at Shinderman Cafe?
A	He -- he's a family friend, and then he had
business at other state. He normally stay out there,
and he started business here. So he asked me to help
him.
Q	And how often was Mr. Charlie Huang at
Shinderman Cafe during the time that you were there?
A	I	would say other two weeks. At the beginning
he was every week I	remember. And then later on would
be two weeks.
Q	Was the name of the cafe when you were hired

was it Shinderman Cafe?
A	Shinderman Cafe.
Q	Have -- do you know anything about whether or
not that cafe had a different name before or after
Shinderman Cafe?
A	Not to my knowledge.
Q	Does the name Mattlorna mean anything to you?
A	Yes. I'm sorry, yes.
Q	And what do you know -- what does Mattlorna
mean to you?
A	I know that Mattlorna was the other owner was
doing business at that location, and then when I hired
as a Shinderman Cafe -- hired to change to Shinderman
Cafe, that's why.
Q	So did it change from Mattlorna to Shinderman
Cafe after you were asked to work there?

A
Q
A

Yeah.
And do you know who the owner of Mattlorna was?
I believe it's either Charlie with the people.

I don't know other partner.

Q
A
Q

But it was Charlie who also -­
Charlie Huang.
-- who was also involved in the business when

it was called Mattlorna?
A	I think so.

Q	Do you know the Ji Jun Zha?
A	No.
Q	You've never heard that name before?
A	No.
Q	What about Alan Shinderman?
A	Alan Shinderman, yes.
Q	When did you first meet Alan Shinderman?
A	That was when -- I believe when I started
working there, just beginning work there.
Q	And what was Mr. Shinderman's position at that
cafe?
A	Exactly position I don't know. I do work with
them on some exterior project like awning project, and I
just work some project for the shop, I work with them
about the project.
Q	Do you have any knowledge as to whether or not
he was an owner or part owner of Shinderman Cafe?

A

I have

owner? I don't recall.

Q

I'm curious, do you know why it was called

Shinderman Cafe as opposed to Charlie Huang Cafe?
A	Yeah, Alan Shinderman, yeah, but that part I do
not know exactly if they have any ownership in there.

Q

Do you know -- do you have any information as

to why it was called Shinderman Cafe rather than any
other name?

A	What I understand Charlie Huang used his name.
Q	I'm sorry. Repeat that.
A	Charlie used his name. That's all I know.
Q	Now, you started working there	I'm sorry
you stopped working there August 1, 2018. Was Mr. Alan
Shinderman still working at the cafe when you stopped?
A	He never actually worked there. All I deal
with him is more about the project. I don't see him
physically working there.

Q
A

Did he -- would he come in to the cafe?
He come in a couple of times. Two, three,

times or four times I see him during my working period
out there.

Q
A

I'm sorry. Repeat?
I only see him like maybe four times during the

period I was working there.
Q	So from February of 2018 to August you saw him
there about four times?

A
Q

Approximately, yeah, if I remember correctly.
And since you've told me that it was a cafe

Mattlorna before it was Shinderman Cafe, would it be
correct to say that when you started working there the
cafe was completely built in terms of having all
appliances and tables and chairs and such in place and
working as a cafe?

people using to communicate each other like American,
not Twitter.

Q
A
Q

It's like Facebook or something like that?
Facebook or something like that.
And when you were at Shinderman Cafe working at

Shinderman Cafe, were you involved or did you use the
WeChat as it referred to the cafe?
A	WeChat, I	don't use WeChat with the
employees.
Q	So I guess I'll rephrase the question if you
don't mind. Did you ever use WeChat to talk about your
employment with Shinderman Cafe?

A
Q

Yes.
Okay. And what did you say on WeChat with

regard to your employment?
A	WeChat use contact sometimes contact Charlie
with it, sometimes contact landlords, business manager,
office manager to -- with some issues. Yeah.
Q	On the WeChat how are -- how are those
conversations kept, meaning if you have a printout of

them or are they on your computer or are they in some
other format?
A	It's in my phone.
Q	Okay. And are you able in your phone to print
out the WeChats as to which you were involved?
A	Yes.
Q	Have you done so before today?
A	No.
Q	When you used WeChat -- I'm sorry -- let me
rephrase that. When you go on WeChat to use it, do
you, like, send the message to somebody?

A
Q

Uh-huh, yes.
And do you recall to whom you would not send a

WeChat message that has to do with the Shinderman Cafe?

A
Q
A

I -- if regard business?
Yes.
I was for any issues for the shop I need to

contact landlord or office manager, I would use that to
send info to.

Q
A
Q

A
Q

A

When you say office manager, who's that?
Fiana? Fiana?
Fiona?
F-i-a-n-a. If you want, I'll check that.
That's okay.
Yeah, F-i-a-n-a. Then we have also Mattlorna

Cafe. We have Jackie Ding, and then Sam in the group
chat. We talk about issues. Okay.
Q	Okay. So you referred to Fiana as the manager.
Is she the manager of the building in which the cafe was
located?
A	Yeah.
Q	And what is Jackie Ding's involvement with the
cafe?
A	I personally did not directly work with her.
It's just in the e-mail contact when the issue happened
people start jumping -- giving the communication in the
group chat.

Q
A
Q

Did you ever meet personally with Jackie Ding?
No.
And do you know the gentleman seated at my

left?

A
Q
A
Q
A
Q

(No audible response.)
And his name is?
Sam Wong.
And have you met him at the cafe?
Couple times.
About how many times during the time period

23	February to August of 2018 did you meet with Mr. Wong at
the premises?
A	If I recall, two to three times.

Q	And what did you meet with him about?
A	First was about the drain, putting

Mr. Wang

was direct me to put the water in the drain to try to
resolve the problem. And second time was the drop off a
check. I	believe it's for the attic fan or some project
that we did. I	drop the check to Mr. Wong.
Q	Did you know of any other efforts that Mr. Sam
Wong did to try to locate the source of the odor?
A	Not to	not directly hearing that
information. Maybe for something, but not directly

Q
A
Q

Okay.
Not directly deal with me. Yeah.
Did you hear from anyone else as to any efforts

that Mr. Sam Wong was doing to try to find the source of
the odors?

A
Q

Yes, from Charlie Huang.
What did Charlie tell you about what Mr. Sam

Wong was doing?
A	He's working. He's finding a source working
with Charlie.
Q	Okay. So was there working together, was that
a cooperative effort between the two of them?

A
Q

From my take, yes. Not to that extent detail.
But you knew that they, meaning Charlie and

Sam, were in communication? They were trying to find

the source of the odor?
A	Right.
Q	Does the name Jonathan Wu mean anything to you?
A	I don't know this person.
Q	Do you know when the Shinderman Cafe closed the
business at that location?
A	If -- early July, July 2nd or 4th. I don't
recall exactly.
Q	So it was in July of 2018, some time there?
A	Yeah.
Q	I don't need to have an exact because it's been
awhile. Okay. Thank you.
A	Yeah, July '18 - - in 2018.
Q	Let's go back to the odor. You mentioned it
certainly was not a pleasant odor?

A
Q
A
Q
A

That's right.
Did it smell like it was some type of sewage?
(No audible response.)
You're nodding your head7	which means yes?
Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. Yes. I'm trying to

recall.
Q	And did that smell happen every day or was
it	or did it just happen occasionally?
A	Happen occasionally what I notice when the
weather is hot. And it sometimes the odor is in the

/�

25-

garage, like you go into the parking lot, it comes -­ it's from where the shops maybe hundred feet away from the shop from the parking lot, you will -- when you go in the shop, you will smell the odor from the parking lot.
Q	You referred to a parking lot. Let me ask you a little bit about the building in which Shinderman Cafe was located. Is the cafe in the large five-story building?
A	Uh-huh. Yes.
Q	And are there any other restaurants or commercial spaces at that building other than on the first floor?
A	So the question is? I'm sorry?
Q	So you've got a five-story building?
A	Uh-huh.
Q	And on the first floor --
A	Yes.
Q	-- we've talked about the Shinderman Cafe?
A	Correct.
Q	Was there another restaurant also on the first floor?
A	Yes.
Q	And do you know the name of that restaurant?
A	Earth.

Q	Earth Kitchen?
A	Earth Kitchen. I just remember the hot pot.
Q	Hot pot, Earth Kitchen. And above the first
floor as far as you are aware everything else are
residential condominiums?
A	Yes.
Q	Okay. Did you ever get any complaints from any
residential tenants that they had odors?

A
Q
A
Q

No, not direct to me.
Does the name Avery Wang mean something to you?
She's owner of the Earth Cafe.
Earth, okay. And did you ever speak to Avery

about these odors?

A
Q

Yes.
What did you speak with Avery about as to the

odors?
A	Just concerns, if she had experienced the same
problems as we did since we're on the same level, same
floor, and then we're in the same running restaurants,
just asking if she has any issues with this.

Q
A
Q

And then what did she say to you?
She said yes.
Did she and you ever talk about whether the

odor issue was better or worse at Shinderman than it was
at Earth Kitchen?

A	I	don't recall.
Q	Okay. To your best recollection do you believe
that she was having an odor issue as often as the
Shinderman Cafe was having an odor issue?
A	I	can't asswne.
Q	Okay.
A	Yeah.
Q	You mentioned the odor was worse when it's hot?
A	Uh-huh. When the issue started happening,
we're trying to figure out what happened. We're trying
to figure it out, what's happening, how we can fix the
problem. So we start taking -- paying more attention to
what exactly is going on as far as I	can do is the
weather it sounds like doesn't happen when the morning.
It happened during the noon or afternoon when it's
getting really hot. It's constantly occurred like that.
Q	So when it's hot, the odor became worse and was
stronger?

A
Q
A
Q

Yeah. More, yes.
And the air-conditioning would not help that? Would not help. Yeah, if it turned on 24/7. Was there a particular place in the restaurant

where the odor was more noticeable?
A	At -- when you first walk in, front of the
register there's a pipe that air comes out. That's very

noticeable from there.
Q	Okay. Can you describe the pipe that you're
referring to?
A	It's like this wide (indicating) black, brown
pipe. It's decor also looks like a vent, the pipe.
Q	So as a vent was there something coming out?
A	Yeah.
Q	And did it appear to you that that was the
source of the odor?
A	I can't tell exactly if the source. It's just
like air-conditioning vent, and then the smell just come
from there.
Q	When you say air conditioning vent, I'm not
sure what you mean. So let me ask it this way: At
least at my house which you've never seen we have vents
that have louvers 1n them, and they're	vents are
typically about this size (indicating) and I'm showing
you this size as being about 12 inches by maybe 8
inches.
MR. ARMSTRONG: That's the vent that's at
issue, something like that (indicating).
THE WITNESS: It's like a pipe decoration hang
over the vent.
BY MR. RONAY:
Q	What we're looking at, and I have to describe

this for the court reporter, at the ceiling in this room
we're in there is what appears to be a vent which is
about a foot square, and it's got little louvers in it?
A	Uh-huh.
Q	So is that the type of thing that you saw near
the cashier's desk from which the odor seemed to come?
A	Not exactly like this.
Q	Okay. How -- in what way was it different than
what we're looking at?
A	It was -- I	don't see that. Maybe it's
restaurant decor. It's a pipe going through, like, it's
a decoration piping that have like -- like plumbing
pipe, the giant bigger size.
Q	Is it a large pipe?
A	Large pipe.
Q	About this big, and by "this big," I'm holding
my hands about 18 inches apart?
A	Uh-huh.
MR. ARMSTRONG: And you said it was like black
or bronze?
THE WITNESS: Black or bronze like a decoration
pipe on the ceiling because I	do not know exactly it's
hooked to the vent. That I	can't tell.
BY MR. RONAY:
Q	But it was coming down from the ceiling of the

restaurant?
A	Right.
Q	Where is the restroom of the facility of the
cafe in relationship to the cashier's desk to which you
were aware of the pipe coming -- I mean, of the vent
coming down?

A
Q
A
Q
A

It's look -- are you looking for the distance? Yes.
Or location? Yes, both.
Both. I would say if the pipe is right there

(indicating), restaurant is in the back of the building,
I kind of gauging 20, 25 feet. It's far away.
Q	So let me try it this way: As you come into
the restaurant --

A
Q

Uh-huh.
-- where 1s the location of the cashier's desk

from the front entry door?
A	The cashier is right here (indicating),
entrance right there (indicating); so I would say when
you walk in directly you would see the cashier.
Q	So as you walk in the cashier's desk is
immediately in front of you and is visible?

A
Q

It's visible.
And when I say immediately, I shouldn't say

that because I have to ask you. Is it like 10 feet?
15 feet?
A	I would say from here to that; so from here to
that (indicating) black.
Q	So you're saying from here where you are
sitting to the cabinet that's on the other side of this
table?
A	Right.
Q	And I am estimating that as·being about
12 feet?

A
Q
A
Q
A
Q

feet.
Is that a close estimate?
Right, yes.
So from the cashier's desk -­
Uh-huh.
-- walk me around to where the restroom would

be located?
A	When you walk in the front door, cashier is
right here (indicating), and then there's a hallway.

Q
A

So there's a hallway to your right?
Hallway to the right to walk in to the restroom

in the back. As we walk in the hallway, there is a
desk, there is chairs and tables. And then all the way
to the back is the restroom.
Q	We guessed at about 12 feet from where you're
First Legal 	32
LA. 855.348.4997

sitting to that cabinet?
A	Uh-huh.
Q	How much further were the restrooms from the
cashier than this 12-foot distance?
A	Maybe one-half, little further than this.
Maybe like if...
Q	Maybe twice as far?
A	1.5.
Q	Okay. That's good. Thank you. Were you
involved in hiring anyone to try to locate the source of
the odor?

A
Q

Hire somebody?
Yes. Did you ever hire someone to find the

source of the odor?
A	I do know the -- at the beginning I didn't hire
anyone. Beginning there is -- I had the bill somebody I
don't know who did it trying to look into the source.
Q	Do you remember the name of the vendor that
billed for the work?

A
Q

Built the work?
No, I'm sorry. That -­ MR. ARMSTRONG: Charged.

BY MR. RONAY:
Q	You got an invoice from someone that had to do
with inspecting the cafe to find the odor; is that

,�
accurate?
A	Yeah.
Q	And you remember the name on the invoice?
A	If I'm correct Sierra Plumbing or something.
Q	Sierra Pacific?
A	Sierra Pacific.
Q	And do you remember about when that was?
A	Before I	came. Before I	start working.
Q	Did Sierra Pacific come in at any time while
you were working as far as you are aware?
A	I don't think I was there.
Q	Do you recall whether there was one or more
than one invoice from Sierra Pacific?
A	I don't remember. It's a small invoice. Only
I think I remember it's a small invoice.

Q
A
Q
A
Q
A
Q

A
Q

Do you know -- do you know what a dba is?
Business dba?
Yes.
Yeah. Do business as.
Correct.
Uh-huh.

Yeah.
And do you know who the name was of the owner

listed for the dba of Shinderman Cafe?

in November 2017 when the business was changed over
because I was doing bookkeeping for them.

would you be able to recognize the name or recall the
name?
A	Yeah. Let me... Jenner, J-e-n-n-e-r. I	don't

Q	It was a male, and the name was at least first
name was what?

A
Q

J-e-n-n-e-r.
Jenner. Okay. I've been asking you about the

change in name from Mattlorna to Shinderman. Was there
a sign identifying the restaurant outside of the
building?

A
Q

As for changing name?
I'm not trying to confuse you, but I sometimes

have difficulty asking a question clearly.
A	This is my first time.
Q	When I walk into a restaurant, I usually see a
sign some place that gives me the name of the
restaurant?
A	Uh-huh.
Q	When you walked up to the Shinderman Cafe, was
there a sign on the building that gave the name of the
restaurant?
A	There's sign was Mattlorna. There's a sign for
Mattlorna.
Q	Do you remember if there was ever a sign for
Shinderman Cafe?
A	That's the project I	was working on to changing
the sign at outside, but inside on the -- there's a sign
for Shinderman Cafe on the inside of the building, I
mean, the shop.
Q	So within the cafe. So inside the cafe there
was a sign that said Shinderman Cafe?

A
Q

Right.
And you were working on a project to change the

exterior sign from Mattlorna. Did that project finish?

A
Q

Did not finish.
So the exterior sign Mattlorna stayed through

at least July 2018?

/�,

A	Wow. Yes. Can I	recall -- can I	take back my
answer.
Q	Sure. Please. We're not here to confuse you;
so if you need to change anything, please do so now.
MR. ARMSTRONG: Yeah.
MR. RONAY: I get confused enough on my own.
THE WITNESS: I really can't recall. We change
the inside and tell the customer we're Shinderman Cafe,
but exterior did we take it out? I don't remember. I
can't remember.
BY MR. RONAY:
Q	If you don't recall, that's a perfectly
reasonable answer.
A	Okay.
Q	So you were working on the project to change
the sign, but you do not recall if it was finished; is
that correct?
A	I recall it's not finished.
Q	Okay.
A	Yeah. It's the project is awning project did
not finish.

restaurant prior to the Shinderman Cafe?
A	No.
Q	Have you ever heard the term vanilla shell

building?
A	No.
Q	Have you ever heard the term rough-in plumbing?
A	No.
Q	I've been asking about the location of the
cashier's desk to the restrooms. Was the odor that you
were aware of on hot days, was it stronger at the
cashier or was it stronger at the restroom area?

A
Q

Stronger at the cashier's area.
Okay. What about the kitchen area, was it --

was there an odor the same type of odor in the kitchen
area?

Do you -- you may not have been involved in it,

but do you know where the trash area is for the
restaurant?

cafe where is the parking area we walk in, that's how I
noticed.
Q	So as you walked into the cafe you noticed the
odor was there?
A	Yeah.
Q	Do you have any recollection of -- let me
phrase it this way: How many cars spaces are in the
parking lot?
A	I	can't...
Q	Are there a lot?
A	There's a lot.
Q	Or a few?
A	There's a lot.
Q	More than just five or ten?

almost entire level other than where the two restaurants
are?

Q	Ms. Hanes, thank you very much. I appreciate
your cooperation. At least you got out of here
relatively quickly.
A	Okay.
MR. ARMSTRONG: Yep. So what happens now is
that we're done with our questioning. And what's going
to happen is the court reporter is going to type all the
questions and answers in a booklet. And then they're
going to give you an opportunity to read the booklet and
make any changes, but I will caution you that if you
change a yes to a no that if you were called as a

witness to trial, either lawyer myself or the gentleman
sitting next to you can make a comment that you changed
from a yes to a no when you first answered the question
you know here, but it's important to get the testimony
accurate, of course; so you want to try to get it right.
THE WITNESS: Yeah.
MR. ARMSTRONG: So you'll have an opportunity
to do that, and then you need to sign the transcript to
say that, yes, you've read it over and this is what you
agree with the answers or at least that's what you
answered to more accurately. Okay.
A	Okay.
MR. ARMSTRONG: And with that I propose we
stipulate that if the court reporter will maintain
custody of the original and then on demand provide it
for trial or hearing purposes as necessary; and if the
original is unavailable, that a certified copy or the
original for whatever reason isn't signed that a
certified copy of the transcript can be used for all
intents and purposes as though if were the original.
MR. RONAY: So stipulated.
(The deposition concluded at 11:17 a.m.)
23	***

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
the State of California that the foregoing is true
and correct.
